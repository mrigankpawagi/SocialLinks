## How *SocialLinks* was made
SocialLinks was made entirely by me, and the only external library I used was *FontAwesome* for the Social Media Website Icons.

I followed some Drupal 8 Module Tutorials from the following links, to get acquainted with Drupal (as I never worked on it before) to get a start.


 1. [Drupal 8 Docs](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/getting-started-background-prerequisites-drupal-8)
 2. [Suyati.com](https://suyati.com/blog/step-step-guide-create-custom-modules-drupal-8/)

 4. [Cloud Ways](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/create-drupal-8-module/)

For reference to a simple working model to understand the skeleton of a module, I referred to [Sidharrell's D8HW Example](https://github.com/sidharrell/D8HWexample).

### Directory Structure

The module consists of the basic `.info.yml` to provide information about the module while installing it, `.links.menu.yml` to specify the path to be linked from *Configuration* section of admin pages, and a `.routing.yml` to specify what should be displayed at which path (the content and the settings) and for whom.

> One of the problems I experienced was that the link for *SocialLinks Configuration* in Configuration page was taking me to `/Social` where the module's content lives, not the settings - even though I had specified `/admin/config/Social/config` in `.routing.yml`.
> 
> The problem was finally solved when I changed `route_name` under `SocialLinks.admin`  to `SocialLinks.config` (which is routed to configuration), which I had mistakenly put to `SocialLinks.content	` (which routes to the content page).

Further, there is a GNU `LICENSE` and `README.md` needed for the Git repository.

The module consists of 2 components - a controller (`SocialLinksController`) and a form (`SocialLinksConfigForm`).

The Controller contains the markup that is returned to the page. This included the `HTML` markup that makes the icons and the hyperlinks, and some `CSS` within `<style></style>` and a link to the `FontAwesome` library. This code was taken from a fiddle I created myself at [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mrigankpawagi/dd24utvp/) earlier.

The Form consists of the Configuration Form that allows Administrators to customize the links to be displayed. It has fields for each social media website and finally a `submitForm()` function. 

> The problem I faced in this was to use the Configuration Settings Given in the Form within my Controller, to alter the markup according to the settings. 
>
>I firstly used 

    \Drupal::config('SocialLinks.facebook')->get('SocialLinks.facebook')
    (for the value to facebook)

> but this returned nothing. I noticed that I hadn't imported the required modules from Drupal Core.

    use Drupal\Core\Form\ConfigFormBase;
    use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;
> This didn't work either and it finally did when I changed the above segment to

    \Drupal::config('SocialLinks.settings')->get('SocialLinks.facebook')

Finally, there is a `.config.yml` at `config → install`  to put some conventional default configuration.
